# Assignment week 3: 


## Let's create a vector that contains the weight of three patients:

patients_weight <- c("John" = 198, "Andrea" = 165, "Will" = 150)

### 1) Use patients' names to get John and Willâ€™s weight 


### 2) Use a logical evaluation to select patients with 
### a weight greater than 155 pounds


### 3) Remove Will from the vector


### 4) Add a new patien to the vector


### 5) Replace John weight with a different number



## Let's create a matrix
